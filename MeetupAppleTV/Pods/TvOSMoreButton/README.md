# TvOSMoreButton
> üì∫ A tvOS button which truncates long text with '... More'.

The TvOSMoreButton is a simple view which aims to mirror the behavior of Apple's "... More" button; as seen in the Movie App.

## Features

If the text is too long to fit with in the button bounds then the text will be truncated and '... More' will be appended.

If the text fits with in the bounds of the button then the button is not focusable.

When the button is focused, pressing select on the Apple TV remote will trigger a callback.

The majority of the UI properties are configurable; like
- the button text
- ellipse text; defaults to '...'
- trailing text; defaults to "More"
- trailing text color and font
- the button text color and font
- shadows and radius
- and More üòâ
